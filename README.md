## What is Novavim?

Novavim is what could be described as a "distribution" of Neovim, packaged in
nix with [nvf]. I have designed it for use in my hosts, but moved it outside of
[Lunix] so that I can use it on systems that do not necessarily come with my
config.

## Can I Use It?

Knock yourself out.[^1] You can also leave any issues or PRs if you think you
can improve anything.

[^1]: I can't imagine why anyone would want to use this config considering how
    inexperienced I am with Neovim, but I'm including this on most of my public
    projects nowadays.

## Credits

Credit goes to all the contributors to [nvf], of course, as well as everyone who
has helped me figure out Neovim and [nvf] itself.
